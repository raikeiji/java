## Why I made this repository

The reason is to remind me anything about my journey, I kinda lost in several years, so this is where I started again. If you want to give me any advice please fork this repository. I'm so happy to hear any advice!

Thanks in advance!

- `Main.java`: I only create one java file which contain any function and theory. You may cosider several commit I made for the milestone level.
